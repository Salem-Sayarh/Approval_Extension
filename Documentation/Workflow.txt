1. ValidateCanSubmit

    Checks no existing Pending header for this PO

    Ensures PO.Status = Open and required fields are populated

    Throws an error if invalid

CreateHeaderRecord

    Inserts a new row in Approval Header

    Sets PurchaseOrderNo, InitiatorUserID := USERID, CreationDateTime := CURRENTDATETIME, CurrentStepNo := 1, OverallStatus := Pending, TotalAmount := PurchaseHeader."Amount"

    Returns the newly created Approval Header record (with ApprovalHeaderID populated)

3.BuildApprovalLines

    Accepts the new header and the PO record

    Determines your template of approvers (hard-coded or driven from a small config table)

    For each step:

    Skips it if PO total < ConditionMinAmount

    Inserts into Approval Line with (ApprovalHeaderID, LineNo, ApproverID, ConditionMinAmount, SequenceNo, StepStatus := NotStarted)

4.CreateHistoryEntry

    Inserts the initial “Submitted” entry in Approval History

    Populates StepNo = 0 (or 1), ActionTaken := Submitted, ActionActorID := USERID, ActionDateTime := CURRENTDATETIME, Comments := ''

5.InitializeFirstStep

    Reads the line with SequenceNo = 1 (if it exists)

    Updates its StepStatus := Pending

    Updates the header’s CurrentStepNo := 1 (though that was already set)

6.CreateNativeApprovalEntry

    Calls the standard Approval Management codeunit (430) to generate the built-in Approval Entry record

    Passes your custom header/line context so the approver sees “PO 1001 – Waiting for your approval”

7.SendNotificationEmail

    Calls SMTP Mail codeunit (400) to email the approver

    Uses a simple template (“You have a new approval request for PO …”)
